# Default icons for TinyMCE 5

This project contains the default icons for TinyMCE 5. Icons is loaded into the editor using a icon pack file. You can use this project as a basis for building your own icon packs. For instructions on how to make your own icon pack, see the [TinyMCE 5 documentation](http://tiny.cloud/docs-beta/advanced/creating-a-skin/#modifyingtheicons)

## Building the icon pack
The icon pack build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Build the icon pack using the `gulp` command.
